```js
import SynologyApi from '@fett/synology-api';

const synologyApi = new SynologyApi(
    server: "https://192.168.1.1:5001",
  username: "username",
  password: "password",
);

const info = await synologyApi.FileStation.getInfo();
```

## Use In CLI

First install the package globally

```bash
npm i -g @fett/synology-api
```

Then run cmd help message
